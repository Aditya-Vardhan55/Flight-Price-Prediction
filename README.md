# Flight-Price-Prediction✈️
## Overview 
The Flight Fare Prediction Model is a machine learning-based system that predicts flight ticket prices based on various factors such as airline, departure time, duration, and more. It helps travelers and businesses make informed decisions by estimating fare trends.
## Features 🚀
💰 Accurate Fare Prediction based on historical data

📊 Machine Learning Model trained with real-world flight data

🔍 Feature Engineering to improve prediction accuracy

🌍 User-Friendly Interface for seamless interaction

📡 Integration with APIs (if applicable) for real-time data updates
## Tech Stack 🛠️
Python (for data processing & ML model)

Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn (for data analysis & ML)

Flask/Streamlit (for the web interface)

Matplotlib & Seaborn (for data visualization)

Jupyter Notebook (for model training & evaluation)
## How It Works ⚙️
Data Collection: Prepares flight data with essential attributes (e.g., airline, departure, arrival, duration, etc.).

Data Preprocessing: Cleans and transforms data for training.

Feature Engineering: Extracts relevant features for better predictions.

Model Training: Uses ML algorithms (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost) to train the model.

Prediction Generation: Estimates flight prices based on user inputs.

Web Interface: Allows users to input details and get fare predictions.
## Dataset 📂
Used a flight price dataset (if applicable) from Kaggle / airline sources.

Contains features such as airline, journey date, duration, departure, arrival, and fare.
